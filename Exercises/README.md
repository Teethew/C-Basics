# Use it to your advantage!
Here are some exercises and functions written in *C* that you can use to understand the basics of the language and its characteristics.  

## Basic functions
- **array_printer** - A function to read and print an array of integers
- **payment_methods** - A program that calculates discounts and interests in different payment methods. Done with the simplest functions possible
- **CelsiusFahrenheit** - A program to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa
- **perimeter_area** - Calculates the area and perimeter of a square, a circle and a triangle
- **dividers** - List the dividers of an integer
- **odd-counter** - Asks how many integers will be analyzed and show and answers how many odd and even numbers were typed

## Recursive functions
- **Rc_array_reverser** - A recursive function to reverse the order of an array of integers
- **Recursive_Factorial** - Calculates the factorial of an ```int``` (you can change it to another type of integer with more bits, like ```long long int``` or ```unsigned int```)
- **Summation** - A recursive function of summation of an ```int``` (you can change it to another type of integer with more bits, like ```long long int``` or ```unsigned int```)
- **biggest** - A recursive function that looks for the biggest ```double``` present in the array
- **even-array** - Receives an array of integers and returns how many of them are even numbers
- **fact_sum** - Reads 2 integers and show the sum of their factorials

## Iterative functions 
- **matrix_folder** - Creates a random square matrix of side n and fold it (summing the numbers in opposite positions)
- **first_index** - Prints a array and after that insert a new number specified by the user in the first index of the array
- **array_product** - Calculate the product point-to-point of 2 arrays
