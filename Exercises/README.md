# Use it to your advantage!
Here are some exercises and functions written in *C* that you can use to understand the basics of the language and its characteristics.  

## Basic functions
- **array_printer** - A function to read and print an array of integers

## Recursive functions
- **Rc_array_reverser** - An recursive function to reverse the order of an array of integers
- **Recursive_Factorial** - Calculates the factorial of an _int_ (you can change it to another type of integer with more bits, like _long long int_ or _unsigned int_)
